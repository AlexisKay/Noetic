Noetic is a 2D platformer that I created as part of my capstone project. Game can be seen at my Itch.io page here: https://alexiskay.itch.io/noetic 
This is my first attempt at my own platformer using Unity and any kind of game development, I have hopes of improving this game to be something bigger.

I used unity for this project and all of my files for this project are included in this repository except for Text Mesh Pro (which is used in Unity, just import it) and AstarPathfinding (https://arongranberg.com/astar/).
