Noetic is a 2D platformer that I created as part of my capstone project. Game can be seen at my Itch.io page here: https://alexiskay.itch.io/noetic 

I used unity for this project and all of my files for this project are included in this repository except for Text Mesh Pro (which is used in Unity, just download it) and AstarPathfinding (https://arongranberg.com/astar/)
